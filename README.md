# Interactive-Product-Case-Study-App-

A system-level product evaluation and redesign prototype focused on improving engagement, cognitive efficiency, and skill transfer within a scalable learning experience.

## Product Context

This project analyzes a consumer learning product and restructures it into a modular, learner-centered architecture. The redesign prioritizes clarity of progression, reduced cognitive friction, and earlier feedback loops while operating within realistic delivery constraints.

## Design Strategy

- Modularized learning architecture to minimize extraneous load  
- Structured progression to support learner confidence and autonomy  
- Increased practice frequency with low-stakes feedback  
- Clear state visibility to reinforce motivation and completion  

## Product Capabilities

- Before/after system comparison  
- Adjustable design variables with dynamic outcome indicators  
- Visualized impact across motivation, confidence, and transfer
